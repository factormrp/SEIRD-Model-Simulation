# SEIRD Model Simulation

*This mini-project is an implementation of solving 1st-order ODE systems. We chose to investigate an SEIRD model because of the vast amount of publicly-accessible academic data and papers on this subject and how it's flexibly used in different settings to model the spread of Covid-19.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Synopsis

We leveraged numerical analysis packages `scipy` and `numpy` to simulate populations. Visualizations are generated using `matplotlib` and we are working on implementing neater animations using `manim`.
